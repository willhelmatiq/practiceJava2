I don't need diamond rings or high-priced suits that shine
Limousines and flashing things or ancient bottled wine
Designer names and lavish things and million dollar hair
Modern dames without a brain, I never really care
I don't care nothin' about it
Whoa, yeah
I don't care for glitzy things or a fancy neighborhood
Glamour games or plastic fame or the king of Hollywood
Dazzling flamboyant things or a top hat on my head
Or modeling for magazines or to be a debonaire
I don't care nothin' about it
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah, whoa
I don't care nothin' about it
Whoa, yeah, whoa
I don't care nothin' about it
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah, whoa
