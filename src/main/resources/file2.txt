Another day goes by
And I don't understand or know the reasons why
I'm looking for a change in life
But another day goes by (by)
Here we go again (by)
It's today (it's today)
I wish it was tomorrow, though I think I'd say (though I think I'd say)
You know, I think it feels just like yesterday
So lately, I've been looking for a change
But the more things change, the more they seem to stay the same
Another day goes by
And I don't understand or know the reasons why
I'm looking for a change in life
But another day goes by (by)
Now here we go again
It's a new day (a new day)
It's almost like tomorrow never came
Same old thing, same old game, different name
And everyday I sing the same old song
And today I don't feel like waking up
But the show must go on, and on, and on
Another day goes by (another day goes by)
And I don't understand, and I don't pretend to try (don't pretend to try)
I wanna change my life (I wanna change my life)
But another day goes by
Just when I get it right
Another day goes by (here we go again)
By, by, by
Now here we go again
If I could change it, or rearrange it
Tomorrow could be alright
So many days gone by
I still don't understand, but now I realize
I'm gonna change my life, that's right
While the days go by
I'm gonna change my life, that's right
While the days go by, yeah
I wanna change my life (I wanna change my life)
But another day goes by (by, by, by, by, by, by...)
It's just another day, another day
